# RAG Library Agent

A local, self-hosted document assistant. Point it at your ebook/PDF library, let it
build a searchable vector index, then ask questions about your collection in a browser
UI. Everything runs on your machine — no cloud, no data leaves your disk.

Books tagged as Fiction/Short Stories in Calibre are treated as fiction: the assistant
will answer questions about their content but won't present it as factual.

## How it works

Your library files (PDF, EPUB, MOBI) get chunked into small passages and converted
into embedding vectors using a local sentence-transformers model. These vectors live
in a ChromaDB index on disk. When you ask a question, the system:

1. Embeds your question and pulls the closest matching chunks from the index.
2. Reranks those chunks with a cross-encoder for precision.
3. Sends the best chunks as context to an LLM (local or remote) to generate an answer.

The LLM doesn't need to know about your library — it just sees the relevant passages
as context. This is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

```
Your library ──► chunk + embed ──► vector index ──► retrieve + rerank ──► LLM ──► answer
  (PDF/EPUB)      (local model)     (ChromaDB)      (top chunks)      (any API)
```

An MCP server is also included so you can use the library as a tool from LM Studio
or any MCP-compatible chat client, instead of the web UI.

## Getting started

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+ on Linux. An LLM API if you want to chat (any
OpenAI-compatible endpoint — local LM Studio, llama.cpp, or a cloud provider).

```bash
git clone <repo-url> rag-web-chat
cd rag-web-chat
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

That single command:
- Creates a Python virtual environment in `.venv/`
- Installs all dependencies (torch CPU wheels, sentence-transformers, ChromaDB, Flask, etc.)
- Downloads the embedding model once (~50 MB)
- Checks if the LLM API is reachable (warns if not — you can still set it up from the UI)
- Starts the web app at **http://localhost:5000**

### Custom options

```bash
RAG_PORT=8080 ./run.sh        # different port
RAG_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./run.sh     # listen on all interfaces (LAN access)
RAG_DEVICE=gpu ./run.sh        # GPU install (NVIDIA driver + VRAM needed)
```

### Manual setup (if run.sh doesn't work)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
# CPU torch first — prevents uv from pulling CUDA wheels
.venv/bin/pip install uv
uv pip install torch==2.14.0+cpu --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
uv pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple
.venv/bin/python scripts/server.py
```

## Using the app

Open http://localhost:5000. The app has four tabs:

**Setup** — Configure your library folders, LLM API endpoint, and embedding model.
There's a folder picker for convenience, and a first-run wizard on fresh installs.
Saving persists everything to `config.json`.

**Scan** — A dry run. Counts your files, flags scanned PDFs that need OCR, and
classifies books as fiction or non-fiction from Calibre tags. Nothing gets indexed.

**Ingest** — Builds or updates the vector index. Runs in the background with live
progress shown on any tab. You can pause, resume, or stop a running job. While
ingesting, the Chat tab is temporarily locked (to avoid concurrent database access).
Re-running is incremental — new files are added, existing ones are skipped.

**Chat** — Ask questions. Each answer shows its sources with similarity scores and
fiction/non-fiction tags. If all your sources are fiction, you get a visible warning.

## Configuration

All settings live in `config.json`:

| Key | Default | What it does |
|-----|---------|--------------|
| `embed_model` | `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small` | Sentence-Transformers embedding model |
| `embed_device` | `cpu` | Device to run embeddings on |
| `chunk_tokens` | `330` | Tokens per chunk (keep under model max) |
| `chunk_overlap` | `60` | Overlap between consecutive chunks |
| `llm_base_url` | `http://localhost:1234/v1` | OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint |
| `llm_model` | `default` | Model ID to request |
| `llm_api_key` | *(empty)* | API key for remote/cloud providers |
| `retrieval_top_k` | `10` | Chunks retrieved per question |
| `ocr_enabled` | `false` | OCR scanned PDFs during ingest |
| `sets` | — | Named library directories (see below) |

### Library sets

You can organize multiple directories under named "sets":

```json
"sets": {
  "fiction": { "path": "/path/to/fiction/library", "kind": "local" },
  "reference": { "path": "/path/to/reference", "kind": "local" }
}
```

### LLM API

The chat backend talks to any **OpenAI-compatible** endpoint. In the Setup tab you
can set the URL, model, and optional API key, then test the connection. This works
with local servers (LM Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM) or cloud APIs.

## MCP server (for LM Studio)

If you prefer chatting in LM Studio's GUI, the library can be exposed as an MCP
server. The model calls `search_library`, `summarize_work`, or `list_collections`
tools while answering questions, grounding its responses in your actual books.

```bash
./run_mcp.sh              # stdio transport (for local LM Studio)
./run_mcp.sh --http       # HTTP transport (for remote/LAN access, port 8765)
```

Then in LM Studio: Settings → MCP Servers → Add (Local or Remote) and point it
at the script/command.

## OCR

Scanned PDFs (no text layer) are skipped by default and flagged in the Scan tab.
Enable OCR in the config or the Setup tab. The system supports two engines —
Tesseract and RapidOCR — and an automatic comparison tool picks the better one
for each file:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/ocr_compare.py /path/to/library         # compare + OCR
.venv/bin/python scripts/ocr_compare.py /path/to/library --sample-only  # compare only
```

OCR is always CPU-bound and significantly slower than text extraction.

## CLI tools

For power users who prefer the terminal:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/scan.py  /path/to/library          # dry-run stats
.venv/bin/python scripts/ingest.py /path/to/library --set veracrypt1  # build index
.venv/bin/python scripts/agent.py --set veracrypt1          # chat in terminal
```

## Where things live

| File | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `config.json` | All settings (embed model, LLM endpoint, chunking, etc.) |
| `index/` | ChromaDB vector index |
| `manifest.db` | SQLite database tracking file ingest status |
| `ingest.log` | Full ingest log |
| `conversations/` | Saved chat sessions (JSON) |

To rebuild from scratch (e.g. after changing the embedding model), delete `index/`
and `manifest.db`, then re-run ingest. The Setup tab also has a "Force re-embed"
option per file.

## Notes

- **GPU install is for future use only.** The app currently forces CPU at runtime
  for embeddings regardless of install mode. OCR is also CPU-only.
- **Fiction classification** depends on Calibre tags. Untagged books default to
  non-fiction.
- **Embedding model tradeoffs:** The default (`multilingual-e5-small`) is fast on
  CPU (~10 files/min). Bigger models (`bge-m3`, `Qwen3-Embedding`) give better
  quality but are 4-10x slower.
- **Portable:** Copy the whole folder to another machine and run `./run.sh`. The
  library itself stays wherever it is.
