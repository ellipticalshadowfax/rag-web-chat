RULES:
- Cited library passages are primary; cite them by title/source when you use them.
- You MAY answer beyond the excerpts using your own knowledge. LABEL the provenance of claims:
  [LIBRARY]  — directly supported by a retrieved excerpt
  [KNOWLEDGE] — from your own general knowledge, inference, or a reasonable connection
- Fiction chunks (kind="fiction") are fiction: reference them only as fiction, never as fact.
- If retrieval found no strong match (a low-relevance note is present), say plainly that the library has no direct coverage of the topic, then answer from your own knowledge clearly labeled [KNOWLEDGE], and propose 2-3 related search phrases (authors, keywords, titles) the user could try in their library.
- When coverage is thin, still suggest related topic/author/keyword routes to redirect the user.
- Never fabricate citations to passages that are not in the retrieved excerpts.
- Be concise and direct; separate what the library says from what you infer."""

# ─── Hybrid retrieval (BM25 lexical leg + RRF fusion) ────────────────────────

# They are hard-coded (not in config.json) because they trade CPU/memory against
# recall, and their sweet spot is largely corpus-size dependent:
#   BM25_TOP_N   — how many BM25 hits to take as the lexical leg before fusion.
#                  More = better recall at the cost of a bigger rerank pool.
#   BM25_BATCH   — rows per Chroma pagination call while (re)building the index.
#                  Chroma caps the returned chunk count, so large corpora MUST
#                  be walked in pages; lowering this hurts build speed, not
#                  quality.
#   FUSE_RRF_K   — the RRF constant (rank score = sum 1/(k + rank)). Larger k
#                  flattens the score curve and gives the lexical leg more
#                  weight relative to the dense pool.
